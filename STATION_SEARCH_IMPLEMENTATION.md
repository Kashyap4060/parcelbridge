# Station Search Dropdown Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive station search dropdown system throughout the Parcel-Bridge PWA that allows users to search and select railway stations from the Firebase database containing 8,151 real Indian railway stations.

## Components Created

### 1. Core Library Files
- **`src/lib/stationSearch.ts`** - Firebase station search functionality
  - `searchStations()` - Search stations by name or code with autocomplete
  - `getPopularStations()` - Retrieve popular/frequently used stations
  - Smart sorting by relevance (exact matches first, then prefix matches)

- **`src/hooks/useStationSearch.ts`** - Reusable React hook for station search
  - Debounced search with 300ms delay
  - Loading states and error handling
  - Popular stations caching

### 2. UI Components
- **`src/components/ui/StationSearchDropdown.tsx`** - Main dropdown component
  - Real-time search with Firebase integration
  - Keyboard navigation (arrow keys, Enter, Escape)
  - Popular stations displayed on focus
  - Responsive design with loading states
  - Clear button and error handling
  - Accessibility features

## Implementation Locations

### 1. Sender Features
- **`src/app/dashboard/sender/create-request/page.tsx`**
  - Pickup Station dropdown
  - Drop Station dropdown
  - Integrated with fee calculation system
  - Real-time fee updates when stations change

### 2. Fee Calculator
- **`src/components/ui/FeeCalculator.tsx`**
  - From Station dropdown
  - To Station dropdown
  - Updated to use async fee calculation with real distance data

### 3. Carrier Features
- **`src/app/dashboard/carrier/journeys/page.tsx`** *(NEW)*
  - Source Station dropdown for train journey
  - Destination Station dropdown for train journey
  - PNR-based journey management
  - Station codes stored for route matching

### 4. Testing
- **`src/app/test/station-search/page.tsx`** *(NEW)*
  - Comprehensive test page for station search functionality
  - Visual feedback for selected stations
  - Test instructions for validation

## Database Integration

### Station Data Structure
```typescript
interface Station {
  code: string;           // e.g., "NDLS", "BCT"
  name: string;           // e.g., "NEW DELHI", "MUMBAI CENTRAL"
  normalizedName: string; // Lowercase for searching
  searchTerms: string[];  // Additional search keywords
}
```

### Firebase Collections
- **`stations`** - 8,151 unique railway stations
- **`stationDistances`** - 424,046 distance pairs between stations
- **`carrierJourneys`** - Carrier journey records with station codes

## Features Implemented

### Search Capabilities
- ✅ Search by station name (partial match)
- ✅ Search by station code (exact and partial match)
- ✅ Case-insensitive search
- ✅ Real-time Firebase queries
- ✅ Debounced input (300ms delay)
- ✅ Results sorted by relevance
- ✅ Popular stations on focus
- ✅ No results handling

### User Experience
- ✅ Keyboard navigation (↑↓ arrow keys, Enter, Escape)
- ✅ Click to select
- ✅ Clear button
- ✅ Loading indicators
- ✅ Error states
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Accessibility labels
- ✅ Auto-complete behavior

### Integration
- ✅ React Hook Form integration
- ✅ Real-time fee calculation
- ✅ Station code extraction for backend
- ✅ Form validation
- ✅ Error message display

## Technical Details

### Performance Optimizations
- Debounced search queries
- Firebase query limits (10 results max)
- Result caching for popular stations
- Efficient deduplication using Map
- Client-side filtering for better relevance

### Search Algorithm
1. **Firebase Queries**: Parallel queries for code and name matches
2. **Deduplication**: Using Map to remove duplicates by station code
3. **Client Filtering**: Additional relevance filtering
4. **Smart Sorting**: 
   - Exact code matches first
   - Exact name matches second
   - Code prefix matches third
   - Name prefix matches fourth
   - Alphabetical fallback

### Firebase Query Strategy
```typescript
// Multiple parallel queries for better coverage
const queries = [
  // Station code search (case-insensitive)
  query(stationsRef, 
    where('code', '>=', searchTerm.toUpperCase()),
    where('code', '<=', searchTerm.toUpperCase() + '\uf8ff')
  ),
  
  // Station name search (normalized)
  query(stationsRef,
    where('normalizedName', '>=', searchTermLower),
    where('normalizedName', '<=', searchTermLower + '\uf8ff')
  )
];
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Implementation
```tsx
<StationSearchDropdown
  label="Pickup Station"
  placeholder="Search stations..."
  value={stationValue}
  onChange={setStationValue}
  onStationSelect={(station) => {
    console.log('Selected:', station.name, station.code);
  }}
  required
  error={errorMessage}
/>
```

### With React Hook Form
```tsx
<StationSearchDropdown
  label="Source Station"
  value={watch('sourceStation')}
  onChange={(value) => setValue('sourceStation', value)}
  onStationSelect={(station) => setSelectedStation(station)}
  error={errors.sourceStation?.message}
  required
/>
```

## Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist
- ✅ Search by popular station names (Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai)
- ✅ Search by station codes (NDLS, BCT, MAS, SBC)
- ✅ Partial name matching
- ✅ Popular stations display on focus
- ✅ Keyboard navigation works
- ✅ Real-time fee calculation integration
- ✅ Form validation and error handling
- ✅ Clear functionality
- ✅ Loading states during search

### Test URLs
- Station Search Test: `http://localhost:3000/test/station-search`
- Create Request (Sender): `http://localhost:3000/dashboard/sender/create-request`
- Carrier Journeys: `http://localhost:3000/dashboard/carrier/journeys`

## Real Data Integration

### Station Database
- **Total Stations**: 8,151 unique railway stations
- **Distance Pairs**: 424,046 station-to-station distances
- **Data Source**: Real Indian Railways train schedule data
- **Coverage**: Comprehensive coverage across India

### Fee Calculation Integration
