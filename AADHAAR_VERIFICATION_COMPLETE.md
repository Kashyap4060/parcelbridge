## 📋 **What Was Implemented**

### ✅ **1. Core Verification Flow**
- **Aadhaar Verification Page**: `/auth/aadhaar-verification`
  - Upload front and back images of Aadhaar card
  - Enter 12-digit Aadhaar number with auto-formatting

  - File size and type validation (5MB limit, images only)
  - Real-time preview of uploaded documents
  - Secure upload to Firebase Storage

### ✅ **2. Database Structure**
- **User Model**: Extended with `aadhaar` and `isAadhaarVerified` fields
- **AadhaarVerification Collection**: Tracks verification requests with:
  - Document URLs, status (pending/approved/rejected)
  - Submission and verification timestamps
  - Admin verification details and rejection reasons
  - Support for multiple verification methods (manual/OCR/DigiLocker)

### ✅ **3. Admin Verification System**

  - View all verification requests with status filtering
  - Real-time updates using Firestore listeners
  - Full document review with image display

  - Statistics dashboard showing verification metrics

### ✅ **4. Security & Permissions**
- **Firebase Storage Rules**: Secure document upload permissions

- **Admin-only Access**: Only admin users can approve/reject verifications
- **Data Privacy**: Encrypted storage and access logging

### ✅ **5. User Experience Integration**

- **Dashboard Restrictions**: Carriers see verification prompt until complete
- **Verification Status**: Clear indication of verification requirements
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Features unlock only after verification

### ✅ **6. Carrier Feature Restrictions**
